                    <h3>PART 1</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once upon a time, there lived an old woman named ''Odochicka'' an aged ''fishy story'' narrator from the lineage of ''Kunabenous'' a fetish priest whose father was a palm wine tapper from the east and coastal part of Africa.
                            Kunabenous the fetish priest once told Odochicka that one from her generation would rob Peter and pay Paul but never wanted ''To blow the gaff'' keeping the information so private for safety reasons, Odochicka replied by saying...........
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            I'm off-color and need some rest, I'm tired of your jesty conversions.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Your gifted ''cock of the walk'' will be assigned to be in hot water from a beloved relative who promptly incants one's soul '' To give up the ghost''.
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            Why do you want ''To kow- tow to me at the eleventh hour '' of my rest? I now know it's blameful to have you in existence kunabenous in my generation.....just let me be for good.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            What do you mean by ''eleventh hour''?
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            It's just a phrase from an unknown source in my dream. I could have retrieved the information but since you made yourself so arduous for peaceful relaxation I couldn't.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Was it a black image with blurry furthers holding a pot decorated like a calabash?
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            Perfectly quoted, but if I may ask, why is Kunabenous asking about the details of my dream and what for?
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            He showed a whipping smiling face and gave out a deep breath . Look into my face as I cry odochicka, If my tears of pain turned into reddish water, then coming your way is a ''red letter- day'' among your gift ones.
                            You may lose your mood if I try ''To hit the nail on the head''. A young talented singer who aims to sing like the ascient instrumentalist from Zimbabwe will lose his soul out of jealousy by a doughtful deceiver.

                    <h3>PART 2</h3>
                        <p>
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            Over the dead bodies of my ancestors, have you soon forgotten the odochicka you know, huh kunabenous, these blasphemy revelations from your burning flames will be watered by the ancestors to erupt only smoke
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Shut up, how dare you provoke the gods of ''OZONKO KINGDOM''
                            Look further to perform libations on behaving to the gods.
                            <br><span>ODOCHICKA:</span>
                            Kunabenous always wanted to feed his gods through unsuspected crimes.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Odochicka, Odochicka !! Stop!! It's an abomination, do you think they will be ''led by the nose'' like how one blood of your kind went on a fool's errand?
                            Suddenly, they heard two voices from afar, singing and drumming like a lively showcase. Their footsteps kept coming closer and closer, 
                            instantly in their view were ''Luka'' and ''Econa'' Odochicka's sons. In the elder son's hand, Luka was a bush meat bleeding on a black calabash in his right hand. Econa the younger son, the singer knew nothing nor secret about the concept. In a short time, econa also brought out a black crocodile egg claiming to be the egg of a bird.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Favored will he be ''To turn over a new leaf'' What will it be worth a brother ''To play a person false'', the black egg must go in hand to the warrior who was responsible for the death of the bush meat.
                            Kunabenous gave a snob to overcome econa's death...
                            Thus, to return the black egg which in econa's hand stands for death to Luka. This means that as Econa has the black egg in hand, he has his death in hand.
                            CONVERSATION KEPT GOING ON......
                            
                            ,<br><span>LUKA: </span> He whispered in an unknown spiritual voice to kunabenous and said, why do you want ''To hit below the belt''. Meaning, why is kunabenous trying to act unfairly in his game against Econa?
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            The gods of my ancestors who live in the darkened world will throw similar dust to one's eye by returning evil for evil.
                            <br><span>ECONA</span>
                            Father of our peaceful land, why are your words so idiomatic and difficult for me to understand? By the way, we have in hand your favorite bush meat for tonight's pepper soup, my brother Luka knelt it down by one gun short.
                            <br><span>KUNABENOUS:</span>
                            Like how his demonic possessions knelt you down in your last moments........
                            Econa, have you forgotten little I'm and little I know? Dead you are held by a brother the greatest undefeatable Emrys with demonic powers inherited by the doom to the waterfalls. He has in hand your cold body that has been tormented and brought to its last breath.
                            <br><span>ECONA: </span>
                            Luka, kunabenous is sounding very strange against my soul............
                            <br><span>LUKA: </span>
                            Never mind, his hobby is to crack jokes to children, let's set up the fire to have this whole day by ourselves.......the gods of our land are hungry, he should be the one asking for the blood of our bush meat to be sprinkled on the gods of ''OZONKO KINGDOM''.
